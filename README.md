**Technologies**

This project was built with:

React (v17.0.2): Frontend library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript (v4.9.5): Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
iTunes API: Provides real-time data for music search queries.
Node.js and NPM: Used for managing packages and running development tasks.
React Scripts: Used for running the app, building production bundles, and running tests.
